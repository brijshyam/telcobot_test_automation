        "response": "If you're experiencing issues with your mobile service, here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially improve your connection:\n\n\nUse Phones Supporting Wi-Fi Calling, VoLTE, 5G, and 4G LTE Band Aggregation:\n\nEnsure your phone supports these technologies, as they can significantly enhance your mobile experience.\n\n\n\nCheck Your SIM Card:\n\nMake sure you are using a 4G LTE SIM card. If your SIM card is old and only supports 2G or 3G, you won't be able to access 4G LTE networks. You can replace your old SIM card for free at any Orange store.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Network Selection:\n\nSet your phone to automatically select the best available network (2G, 3G, or 4G LTE). This allows your phone to choose the optimal network based on your location.\n\n\n\nCreate a Coverage Map at Home:\n\nIdentify areas in your home where the signal is strongest. You can use special apps to measure signal strength accurately and find the best spots for making calls or using mobile data.\n\n\n\nWi-Fi Calling:\n\nIf you have a weak mobile signal at home but a strong Wi-Fi connection, use Wi-Fi Calling to make calls over your home internet. This service is available on selected phone models and costs the same as regular calls in your plan.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve your mobile service experience. If issues persist, you may want to contact Orange customer support for further assistance.",

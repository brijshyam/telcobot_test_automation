Here are some common problems and their solutions:\nPrinter Working but not Printing\n\nCause: This could be due to a misalignment or software glitch.\nSolution: Check the printer for any misalignment before starting a new printing process. Update your printing software and troubleshoot any problems that may be causing the glitching.\n\nNot Sticking to the Bed\n\nCause: The print is not sticking hard enough on the bed due to wrong chemicals or temperature variations.\nSolution: Use the right mix of materials and chemicals. Clean the bed before printing to remove dust. Heat the platform in advance and apply some glue if necessary.\n\nGetting Cracks\n\nCause: The cooling process is faster than the rate at which the printer can lay new layers.\nSolution: Increase the temperature in the extruder by about 10 degrees Celsius. Maintain the overall temperature of the entire printer within recommended parameters.\n\nPrint Head Missing the Bed\n\nCause: Misconfiguration of parts or a misalignment of the nozzle.\nSolution: Calibrate the printer settings and clean the nozzle to unclog any material that may have blocked it.\n\nWarping\n\nCause: The nature of plastic and temperature changes.\nSolution: Use a heated platform to maintain high temperature during printing. Use the right raw material and calibrate everything to the right parameters.\n\nMessy First Layer\n\nCause: Blurriness in detail or unwanted lines.\nSolution: Ensure the first layer is laid down correctly as it is the foundation for the entire print.\n\nIf these solutions do not resolve your issue, please reach out to our support team via contact@elegoo.com for further assistance.",

        "prompt": "How can I improve the adhesion of prints on the Elegoo Mars build plate?",
        "response": "To improve the adhesion of prints on the Elegoo Mars build plate, you can follow these steps:\n\n\nCheck Resin Settings: Ensure you are using the correct resin settings. You can refer to the official resin setting suggestions provided by Elegoo.\n\n\nLevel the Build Platform: Make sure the build platform is properly leveled. Here’s a quick guide on how to level the build plate:\n\nFasten the rotary knob and loosen the screws with an M5 L-type Long Wrench.\nPlace a piece of A4 paper under the platform.\nPress \"Tool\" - \"Manual\" - \"Home\" and wait for the Z-axis to go down and stop.\nAdjust the platform to keep it in the center position and fasten the screws with the wrench. Fasten the #1 screw first, then the #2 screw.\nEnsure there is some resistance when pulling the A4 paper out with slight effort. If the paper cannot be pulled out or the resistance is very high, raise the Z-axis by 0.1mm. If there is no resistance, lower the Z-axis by 0.1mm.\n\n\n\nAdjust Temperature: The temperature of the printing environment can affect adhesion. If the temperature is low, increase the bottom exposure time by about 10 seconds to help the model adhere better to the build plate.\n\n\nAdjust Exposure Time: Different resins require different exposure times. For example:\n\nELEGOO Maroon & Black: Bottom Layer Count: 5, Bottom Exposure Time: 90 seconds, Exposure Time: 15 seconds.\nELEGOO Translucent: Bottom Layer Count: 5, Bottom Exposure Time: 70-75 seconds, Exposure Time: 12-15 seconds.\nOther Colors of ELEGOO Resin: Bottom Layer Count: 5, Bottom Exposure Time: 60-70 seconds, Exposure Time: 8-10 seconds.\n\n\n\nIncrease Bottom Exposure Time for Larger Models: If the model is large or heavy, increase the bottom exposure time to 70-75 seconds to ensure better adhesion.\n\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, you can take pictures or a short video of the problem and send it to 3dp@elegoo.com with your order number for further assistance.",
